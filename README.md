# Tic-Tac-Toe-game
This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game created by me to test and practice some Javascript functionalities.
The game has the following features:
1, Modal
2, Form validation
3, Name validation
4, Handling data/managing and storing data.
5, Creating JavaScript Object (new formData() ).

Project planning:
1, Configure player names -: Using form with Input field in Modal Overlay and also validate user input and show validation feedback.
2, (Re) start game button: Start game button should clear current game board and game over message.
3, Turn-based gameplay -: Turns should switch automatically between the two players and every player has his/her own symbol.
4, Select field and check for winner-: When game fields are clicked the player's symbol is displayed and the JavaScript check for winners after every turn.
5, Show "Game-over" window -: Present "Game-over" message which highlights winner or draw once the game ends.
